=============

Connect-s4a is a middleware for Connect framework. It provides a easy way to
proxify GET requests from non-js clients to SEO4Ajax.

This middleware must be on the first called.

With connect :

    var connect_s4a = require('connect-s4a');
    var token = "your site token on SEO4Ajax";
    var connect = require('connect');
    var app = connect();
    app.use(connect_s4a(token));
    app.use(function(req, res){
        res.end('hello world\n');
    });
    app.listen(3000);
    
With express :

    var connect_s4a = require('connect-s4a');
    var token = "your site token on SEO4Ajax";
    var express = require('express');
    var app = express.createServer();
    app.use(connect-s4a(token));
    app.get('/', function(req, res){
        res.send('hello world');
    });
    app.listen(3000);

Connect-s4a take only one parameter, the token of the site on SE04Ajax.


Installation
------------
Via npm :

    $ npm install connect-s4a

How it works
------------

This module checks the presence of the _escaped_fragment_ query parameter or the presence of a user-agent string identifying bots that do not support the Ajax Crawling Specification.
If the _escaped_fragment_ is present or a bot is detected, it requests the snapshot on SEO4Ajax and responds to the initial request with the concerned snapshot.


Requirements
------------

- node (>= 0.10.0)
- connect (>= 0.2.4) or express (>= 0.3.0)


Tests
-----

    node tests/run.js
